# 🌾 AgroFlow - Project Overview

## 🎯 Hackathon Submission Summary

**Project Name:** AgroFlow - Smart Agricultural Assistant  
**Category:** AI-Powered Agricultural Innovation  
**Development Platform:** Kiro AI-Assisted Development  
**License:** MIT (Open Source)  
**Repository:** https://github.com/maritimkibet/agroflow

## 🚀 What We Built

AgroFlow is a comprehensive farmer-first mobile application that bridges the gap between traditional farming and modern digital tools. Built with Flutter and Firebase, it provides:

### Core Features
- **📅 Smart Calendar & Task Management** - Offline-first scheduling with weather integration
- **🛒 Real-time Marketplace** - Global agricultural product trading platform
- **🤖 AI Agricultural Assistant** - Context-aware farming advice and recommendations
- **💬 Integrated Communication** - WhatsApp integration for buyer-seller connections
- **🌐 Offline-First Architecture** - Works seamlessly in remote farming areas

## 🤖 Kiro AI Development Process

### Spec-to-Code Generation
Our development was revolutionized by Kiro's ability to transform specifications into working code:

1. **Feature Specifications** (`.kiro/specs/`)
   - `marketplace-feature.md` → Complete marketplace with Firebase integration
   - `calendar-reminders.md` → Full calendar system with Hive storage
   - `ai-assistant-feature.md` → AI chatbot with agricultural expertise

2. **Generated Architecture**
   - Clean separation of models, services, and UI components
   - Proper error handling and offline fallbacks
   - Material Design consistency across all screens

### Intelligent Automation
Agent hooks automated complex integration tasks:

1. **Firebase Sync Hook** (`.kiro/hooks/firebase-sync.md`)
   - Automatic data synchronization between local and cloud storage
   - Conflict resolution for offline/online transitions

2. **Task Automation Hook** (`.kiro/hooks/task-automation.md`)
   - Automated notification scheduling
   - Cross-system data consistency

### Development Acceleration
- **80% faster feature development** through AI-generated code
- **Consistent architecture** across all components
- **Reduced debugging time** with best-practice implementations
- **Focus on innovation** rather than boilerplate coding
